# Homework-07

## In this homework I will be implementing the skills I have learned throughout the Node.JS course. I will be creating a small application that takes in user input to create the readme that best suits their liking for the project the user is creating.

## This application is meant to add some personality to the project for the user, the user will be able to edit a slew of options that are presented to them when they intialize the application.

## This will give users the flexibility to update things like badges and contributors to whatever project they were working on!
